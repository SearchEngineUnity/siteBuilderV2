  Gatsby minimal starter
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the minimal starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the minimal starter
    npm init gatsby
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-gatsby-site/
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

    Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time!

## Sanity migration

1. [Step by step guide](https://www.sanity.io/docs/example-migrating-the-blog-template-from-studio-v2-to-v3)
2. [Migrating the CLI - This migrates sanity.json to sanity.cli.js](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-the-cli)
3. [Studio configiration - This migrates the other part of sanity.json to sanity.config.js. We are not currently using](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-studio-configuration)workspaces.
4. [Schema and schema types - This one is used migrate custom input components and preview components.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-schema-types)
5. [Preveiw list view - This is the current document that has been helpful for custom input components and preview components.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/previews-list-views)
6. [Structure Builder - The majority of the migration has been completed but the custom preview (of button, form, section) has not been yet implemented.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-custom-structure-and-default-document-node)
7. [Migrating Plugins](https://www.sanity.io/docs/migrating-plugins)
8. [Document actions](https://www.sanity.io/docs/document-actions)

## Gatsby Preview Button

2. [Document action](https://www.sanity.io/docs/document-actions)
3. [Code for the plugin - Use this code to build our preview instead of installing it directly as this plugin is not Sanity V3 compatible](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40nwazuo/sanity-plugin-gatsby-cloud-preview?activeTab=explore)

## Gatsby Migration
We technically didn't 'migrate', we installed the newest V5 and slowly moved the stuff into it.

1. [Migrate v3 to v4](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/) No action was required
2. [Migrate v4 to v5](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v4-to-v5/)
**Some highlights**
Change to IE support
Updated sort
Set up trailing slash to never isntead of using a package to acheive this
Migrate to head api instead of using gatsby-react-helmet or react-helmet
When you start up the playground it will be GraphiQL now
removal of use of <StaicQuery />
All dependencies were reinstalled to gatsby v5 compatible other than gatsby-theme-material-ui (they need to update their dependancy still)
Material UI migration
3. [Migrating to v5 getting started](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migration-v4/)
**only code mod is needed here**
4. [Style change](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/v5-style-changes/)
**Notes**
A lot of these changes noted are updated automatically by the code mod. Note the changes to the renamed items.
I manually updated all the overrides to components instead of using the adaptV5Theme function done by the code mod
I think it is easier to just remember there are new ones to do things for component definition as we don't do this often anyways
migrated styled from styled-components to styled from @mui/material/styles
migrated makeStyles and withstyles to tss-react/mui because I cannot tell if the new functions from @mui/styles still accepted props... it migh've worked fine - we can always revisit this to drop a package if we don't need to use tss-react-mui.
5. [Component changes](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/v5-component-changes/)
**All of this has not be explicitly migrated if untouched by code mod. we will pick up when we go through each components more closely, esp the breakpoint stuff**
6. [Migrating from JSS](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migrating-from-jss/)
**Notes**
Sx prop is used instead of makestyles in a lot of places
This is where I got confused if i should be using styled from @mui/material/styles or @mui/styles.
This is where I learned to ust tss-react for makestyles and withstyles - again this may not be required according to above note

## Update to 'Serializer' code
We have moved off the: [deprecated package](https://github.com/sanity-io/block-content-to-react) to the new [portable text to react.](https://www.sanity.io/docs/portable-text-to-react)
